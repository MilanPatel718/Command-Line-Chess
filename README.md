# Command-Line-Chess
This project creates a chess game on the command line with basic rules of chess implemented (enpassant and castling also implemented). 
As in regular chess, white starts followed by black. Moves are inputted as FileRank FileRank (e.g "a2 a3").
The program will idenitfy invalid moves but will also assume valid input (e.g not moving an empty tile, using proper FileRank values, etc.)
Run the game by running the chess.java class!
